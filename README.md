Automation of Claim Processing Systems Using RPA(Robotic Process Automation)

OUR VISION

 Automate the government supervised public facilty portals ( Eg.Bhamashah Beema Yojana Portal )
 Use RPA (Robot Process Automation) which would train a software bot to augment the work done by the assigned person.

WHAT IS ROBOT PROCESS AUTOMATION ?

 Robotic process automation (RPA) is the use of software with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to handle high-volume, repeatable tasks that previously required humans to perform. Eg. queries, calculations and maintenance of records and transactions.

Targeted Loopholes in present manual systems:-

 A huge share of government resources are consumed in order to operate government portals which involves repetitive tasks such
as data entry and in feeding redundant queries.
 Human vigilance over the system operations are prone to human bias and error.
 Prone to corruption practices.
 Traditional claims processing depends heavily on manual labour. This makes the process increasingly inconsistent and prone to errors. Non fulfilment of claim conditions and requirements by the applicants resulting in unnecessary workload.
Rapid updation of govt. policies for claims keep citizens unaware of their eligibility.
 Manual processing time is higher.
 In the labyrinth of software, processes, applications, and systems, data often get lost or become extremely hard to retrieve. This can go on to greatly increase the cost, as well as the dedicated time data retrieval takes.

Solution Track

Many of the claim providers already implement some level of automation, be it basic automation like scanning PDF documents or more advanced automation of entire workflows. However, these solutions are disparate and come with their own set of challenges. Actually, they can further add to the complexity and difficulty of processing. The quality of output from these automation depends largely on the quality of programming. Every time there is a change in the process, the entire programming needs to be overhauled. Another
shortcoming is that they still rely on manual input from human workers to process and navigate data between different systems. This burdens the claims process, leaves it exposed to errors, and adds extra cost. This is where Robotic Process Automation (RPA) comes in as a fully integrated, end-to- end automation solution that overcomes the above-mentioned obstacles. RPA works at the presentation layer, integrating with all applications and systems, including legacy systems, without creating disruption. It is entirely scalable according to necessities and has up to 100% robotic accuracy.

Some of the main points about RPA that one should keep in mind,

 By the use of RPA (Robot Process Automation) technology Claim Verification will be automated according to the latest government rules.
 Software bots will deal with various data formats to extract
relevant data from application.
 All intermediate steps will deal by bots to save times of both
applicants and Claim Provider
 Single web app or mobile app platform for the citizens will ensure transpirancy and will highly speed up the whole process.

Advantage of using RPA (Robot processing Automation):-

Unified integration
Robots can seamlessly integrate different systems and software, including CRM, ERP, Helpdesk, Claim Application Software, and more. Even better, you can also be assured of a perfect fit with your legacy applications.

Operational accuracy and speed
Eliminate the margin of human error of manual data entry and speed up processing by streamlining work distribution. With RPA you can cut in half the average time required to process a claim, while significantly increasing customer satisfaction. All of this, while reducing costs.

Increased efficiency
By using RPA, all the burdensome and repetitive tasks are taken care of automatically, so employees can be used more efficiently in processes and tasks that require higher level thinking and judgment. An evolution in all directions.
